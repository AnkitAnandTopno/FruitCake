## How to make fruit cake

We can make fruit cake in 3 simple steps.

### Step 1.Boil the dry fruits

In a medium saucepan, combine the butter with the raisins, cranberries, brown sugar,molasses and water and bring to a boil. Simmer over moderately high heat for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and let stand for 45 minutes or until it is cool.

### Step 2.Add all the rest of ingredients

Add the eggs (lightly beaten) and vanilla extract (optional) and the nuts.

Add in the flour mix which is Flour+Baking powder+Salt+Ground spices+Zest of orange and lemon.I didnâ€™t add the spices and the zest of lemon and orange into the boil mix because we need to preserve the fresh smell of those spices and that of lemon and orange.

The taste of a fruit cake is mostly the aroma of that cake ðŸ™‚

Mix everything together, just until everything is well incorporated.

### Step 3.Bake the fruit cake

Transfer the batter into the prepared pan.7 inch pan / 8 inch pan will work. Bake in the center of the oven @ 320F for about 75-90 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

Large baking tray (8 inch) will take slightly less baking time.

Let the cake cool completely.

Unmold the cake and transfer to a serving platter. This fruit cake is best to serve the next day.The flavor and texture of cake improves a lot with that time.The cake may seem buttery and crumbly and less flavorful if we cut it immediately it is cooled.
